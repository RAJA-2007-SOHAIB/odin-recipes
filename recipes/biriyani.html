    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Biriyani</strong> is a beloved South Asian rice dish renowned for its rich <em>aroma, vibrant colors, and
            layered spices</em>. Often considered <strong>Pakistan's national dish</strong>, it combines <em>fragrant
            basmati rice</em> with <em>marinated meat, saffron, and caramelized onions</em>, slow-cooked to perfection.
        Every region adds its own <em>twist</em>—be it Sindhi, Hyderabadi, or Karachi-style—making biryani not just a
        meal, but a <strong>cultural identity</strong>. Served at weddings, festivals, and daily dinners alike, it
        unites people through tradition and taste. Its global popularity continues to grow, admired for both its flavor
        and heritage.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 small green chile peppers</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried mint</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>5 sprigs cilantro</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, skin removed and cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2 quarts water</li>
        <li>4 cups uncooked basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>4 pods green cardamom</li>
        <li>1 pod black cardamom</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon powdered yellow food coloring</li>
    </ul>



    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 1: Prepare the Masala Base</strong><br>
    Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in yogurt and vinegar until well combined. Add chopped onion and cook, stirring frequently, until golden and tender. Add chopped tomatoes, chile peppers, garlic, and ginger paste. Cook until the tomatoes become soft and start breaking down. Season with garam masala, mint, salt, and pepper. Finally, stir in chopped cilantro and mix well.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Step 2: Cook the Chicken</strong><br>
    Place the chicken pieces into the tomato-onion masala mixture in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the skillet, and cook while stirring occasionally. Continue cooking for about 45 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and its juices run clear. For safety, ensure the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) using an instant-read thermometer.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Step 3: Cook the Spiced Rice</strong><br>
    While the chicken is cooking, bring water and rice to a boil in a large pot. Add a cinnamon stick, bay leaf, green cardamom, and black cardamom. Season with salt to taste. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the rice is tender and all the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Once cooked, remove and discard the whole spices.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Step 4: Assemble the Biryani</strong><br>
    Spread half of the cooked rice at the bottom of a large serving dish. Pour the cooked chicken and masala mixture over the rice. Cover with the remaining rice. Lightly sprinkle food coloring on top for presentation. Mix gently before serving.
