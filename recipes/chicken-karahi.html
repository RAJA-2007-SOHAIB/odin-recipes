    <h2>descripsion</h2>
    <p>This dish gets its name from a <em>karahi</em>, a flat open pot used a lot in Pakistani and Indian cooking. In
        spite of its name, this recipe can be made in any pot. it's a little spicy (by Pakistani standards), but simple
        and foolproof.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>1/2 cup sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 whole chicken, giblets discarded, cut these into 12 pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 ginger and garlic paste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoons red chile powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
        <li>6 ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>4 green chile peppers, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh cilanto leaves, finely chopped</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Initial Fry & Spice Infusion</h3>
    <p>Begin by heating oil in a large pot or karahi on high flame. Add the chicken pieces and sauté for around 5
        minutes until they begin to brown. Pour in some water, then mix in cumin, salt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili
        powder, and turmeric. Stir everything together and let it cook for about 30 seconds until the aroma is released.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Simmer With Tomatoes & Chillies</h3>
    <p>Add chopped tomatoes and green chilies to the pot, stirring them in. Lower the heat to a gentle simmer, cover
        with a lid, and cook for about 30 minutes—until the chicken is fully cooked through and no longer pink at the
        bone. For accuracy, the internal temperature near the bone should reach 165°F (74°C).</p>



    <h3>Step 3: Garnish with Cilantro</h3>
    <p>Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and let them cook briefly—about 30 seconds—just until they start to wilt.</p>
